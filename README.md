# Scripts
This repository contains python based scripts for automating services. Currently it holds the scripts for:
1.  Automating the shutdown of AWS services that have been idle for more than 1 hour (thus saving cost)
2.  Automating the cleanup and folderization of downloads folder in a computer.
